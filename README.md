# Casino
Java Casino Game (Runs on Console)

This was my first large programming project (Worked on it with a team). I was very new to programming, so I didn't use OOP concepts efficiently. 
The game emulates the experience of going to a casino without paying actual money. It includes several mini games that are listed below: 
  1. Slot Machine
  2. BlackJack
  3. Keno
  4. Roulette
